                Nestled in the picturesque countryside of Grand Rapids,
                Robinette's Orchard is more than just an apple-picking
                destination; it's a wholesome, family-friendly experience that

              <p class="mobile-hidden" id="rb-mobile-seemore">
                From the moment you set foot on the grounds, you're greeted by
                the sight of sprawling apple orchards, each tree laden with the
                rich hues of ripe fruit. The orchard offers a variety of
                apple-picking options, allowing visitors to fill their baskets
                with crisp, freshly picked apples straight from the tree. The
                air is infused with the sweet scent of apples, creating a
                sensory experience that signals the arrival of fall.

                  While apples take center stage, Robinette's Orchard is a
                  cornucopia of agricultural delights. Traverse the orchard
                  lanes to discover a bounty of pumpkins, gourds, and other
                  seasonal produce, creating a patchwork of colors that mirrors
                  the autumn landscape. The charm extends beyond the trees,
                  inviting visitors to explore the vibrant tapestry of the
                  orchard.

                  Families with children will find an array of activities to
                  keep the little ones entertained. A charming hayride offers a
                  scenic tour of the orchard, providing a relaxing way to absorb
                  the beauty of the fall foliage. The orchard also features a
                  delightful petting zoo, where friendly animals captivate the
                  hearts of young visitors.

                  No trip to Robinette's Orchard is complete without a visit to
                  the country store, where the aroma of fresh-baked goods
                  beckons. Indulge in mouthwatering apple cider donuts, sip on
                  warm apple cider, and explore shelves filled with locally made
                  jams, jellies, and other artisanal treats. The store is a
                  treasure trove of flavors that encapsulate the essence of the

                ArtPrize, the annual art extravaganza in Grand Rapids,
                transforms the city into a vibrant canvas where creativity knows
                no bounds. Picture this â€“ the streets of Grand Rapids bursting
                with life as art installations, sculptures, and interactive
                exhibits pop up at every corner. ArtPrize turns the entire city
                into an urban art gallery, where creativity spills onto
                sidewalks, parks, and unexpected nooks, creating a dynamic and
                ever-changing masterpiece.

              <p class="mobile-hidden" id="ap-mobile-seemore">
                One of the most exciting aspects of ArtPrize is the incredible
                diversity of artistic expressions. From avant-garde sculptures
                to thought-provoking paintings and cutting-edge multimedia
                installations, the event showcases the full spectrum of artistic
                ingenuity. It's a celebration of creativity that transcends
                traditional boundaries and challenges conventional notions of
                art.

                  with the art, offering a unique opportunity to connect with
                  creators and gain insight into the inspiration behind each
                  piece. The dialogue between artists and the public adds an

                  As the name suggests, ArtPrize is not your typical art
                  competition. The event awards significant cash prizes, but
                  it's the public that holds the power to vote for their
                  favorite artworks. This democratic approach ensures that the
                  people's voice shapes the narrative of the event, fostering a
                  sense of community involvement and empowerment.
                </p>
                <p>
                  During ArtPrize, the city buzzes with a festive atmosphere.
                  Outdoor performances, live music, and spontaneous art
                  happenings contribute to the lively ambiance. Local businesses
                  often join the celebration, incorporating art into their
                  storefronts, making the entire city a playground for artistic
                  exploration.
